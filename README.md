# About The Project
#### Morning Routing Task List
Mornings are the toughest part of the day for my family. This app is for my kids to check-off their morning routine tasks so they can ensure everything they need to do is done, and hopefully have some more fun doing it.

### User Story
AS A parent    
I WANT a way to ease the burden of the morning routine for my kids  
SO THAT there is less stress about getting them out the door on-time  

As A child  
I WANT a list of tasks to do each morning  
SO THAT it is easier and more fun for me to complete them

### Acceptance Criteria

GIVEN a list of tasks that need to be completed each morning  
WHEN I am presented with the list of tasks  
THEN I am given an intuitive way to mark them as complete  
WHEN I mark off the wrong task  
THEN I should have an easy way to uncheck the task  
WHEN I complete all the tasks  
THEN I am able to notify my parents I am done through text or email  
WHEN I do all the tasks for a certain number of days in a row  
THEN I should be notified and be given a reward
